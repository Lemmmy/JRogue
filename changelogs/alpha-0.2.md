# Code
- Changed the root package to `jr`
- Moved everything into smaller categorised packages
- Greatly reduced the size of the Player class by moving all their methods into visitors (OOP visitor pattern)
- Pressure washed many classes including Prompt and Container
- Changed all the TileType stuff to have TileFlags, a bitfield of flags so that there are no crazy large if statements simply checking if the tile is a door of any state
- Completely refactored level generators so that many generators can share similar systems (e.g. rooms)
- Removed stupid Optional fields
- Levels have a climate option now
- Serialised objects now also have a dynamic layer of persistence, ready for extremely case-specific serialised fields, and also mods
