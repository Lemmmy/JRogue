 * An aspect is something an entity knows about an item. A persistent aspect is known by all entities with the same
 * type forever, a non-persistent is specific to that item instance and will differ between all items.

 * An example of a persistent aspect is the shape of a bow. When a player identifies the shape, they will permanently
 * remember the name of the shape, and associate it with all other bows with the same shape.
 *
 * An example of a non-persistent aspect is the beatitude (blessed, uncursed or cursed status) of an item. The
 * beatitude differs between every item, so it's non-persistent.
